We the Masters of the Dark Arts
Passengers smashed up in the car parts
Glass sticking into the last
Ticking of hard hearts this is a massacre
It’s the underground of passages
Fiercest of the animals that
Run around in Africa bastard kids of Lazarus
The laughter of the scavengers
Painted on the ceilings of the
Chapels of the savages
There’s nothing left that could embarrass us
We conquered the jungle, built a kingdom
And destroyed your whole establishment
Just the idea, the unseen, is insane
The whole world seen through one
Dream from one king
The pace walked from a gun
Duel with a ten chant
The Art of War, not a Sun Tzu
But a Rembrandt
There isn’t many who pursue what we do
We bear fruit from the Tree of Life
And feed it though the root of evil
For thousands of years power polluted people
Now our trusted brand stands
Amidst the madness bringing you the sequel
Masters of the Dark Arts
The masters of puppets we on another planet
Not even NASA can touch us
Masters of the darkest reaches of reality
Enter the gallery and
Witness organized anarchy
Master of the Dark Arts
Masters of universal law
Pray for peace but indisputable at war
Masters of the darkest hours of our time
Masters of our destiny
We the masters of our lives
Masters of the Dark Arts
Blasting firearms bark
Assassins dive in the high
Tide and find sharks
Past designed to glide by like cyanide darts
And climb cataracts the size of
The sky that blind gods
And give lightning bolts to frightening cults
From a nuclear bazaar bought and
Sold amongst sheisty folks
Popes, Ayatollahs and Shamans
Ogres and goblins, cobras and moccasins
Soldiers rub shoulders with congressmen
Saudi Arabians own Twitter
Skull and Bones own Google and Facebook face
Off, get your face took
Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body
Secret societies got me creeping
With the shotty
La Coka Nostra like Peter Gotti
I got an evil army that feast like zombies
A high priest as Ozzy
Carve my enemy’s forehead
With tattooed Swazis
We kamikaze like Carmine Lupertazzi
Masters of the Dark Arts
The masters of puppets we on another planet
Not even NASA can touch us
Masters of the darkest reaches of reality
Enter the gallery and
Witness organized anarchy
Master of the Dark Arts
Masters of universal law
Pray for peace but indisputable at war
Masters of the darkest hours of our time
Masters of our destiny
We the masters of our lives
