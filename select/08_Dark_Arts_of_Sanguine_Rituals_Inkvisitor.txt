Arriving to the scene
Corpse on a plain sight
Murder!
It cannot be unseen

A body to be found
In an obscure manner
No blood on the ground
Bloodletting by a master

The purity
He took his time
He had a vision
To perfect the crime

Clearly a ritual Has to be a clue
Seems sacrificial
An M.O. truly new

Red ruM
The dark ritual
Red ruM
Body void of blood
Red ruM
The madness perpetual
Red ruM
A lust for sanguine lifeblood

Wasn't the first
Sure as hell won't be the last
He'll kill again
I'll have to move fast

There's no lead
He's too good
A mastermind indeed
Those in hollywood

The puzzle will be solved
I'll crack the case
The mystery unveiled
He'll leave a trace

The act was brutal
Like a piece of art
Resistance futile
But I can tell them apart

Red rum
The dark ritual
Red rum
Body void of blood
Red ruM
The madness perpetual
Red rum
A lust for sanguine lifeblood
